What is Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock?
RPSLS is just like Rock Paper Scissors, each player has to choose any one variable Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard or Spock. Each of the players keep their selection secret while priming. The players then reveal their choice on the 4th prime, One Two Three Shoot. The priming phase where the players will use their arms to regulate speed is used to create a sense of timing between the two competitors creating a more accurate competition. Players often use a rock gesture during the priming phase of the competition, but any gesture is permitted as long as they are not obscene. During tournament play, only the rock symbol is permitted. If there is a tie on a throw, the players simply replay the point. In competitive play, players compete in a best 3 of 5 although in everyday play a one-shot winner takes all is permitted.
